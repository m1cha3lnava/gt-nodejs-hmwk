## Description

I created a quick and easy readme generator that takes the guess work out of creating a readme file. 
Readme files give a user important information like what packages, dependencies, or instructions the user will need.
This program prompts you with basic questions via a Command Line Interface that will be used to fill out your readme file.
As a developer we like to automate and this does just that. No more struggling to think of what to put into your readme.md file. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

After downloading the repo, run the command `npm install` to install the dependencies

## Usage

Use the command `node .\index.js` to run the program.
